This app is an External API Tool that allows the user to search for a
specific book using the title and author name as search queries. Upon
searching for the book, the app then displays the cover and several
statistics about the specific book. Below the cover, the app also displays
the covers of 4 other books written by the author.

TODO WRITE / REPLACE

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

One thing that I learned on this project was that APIs willoftentimes not
work the way that you need them to, so it is common to write additional logic
that allows you to assess the information that is received in a JSON.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start this project from scratch, I would try to implement a
user interface that allows the user to select their book from a loaded list
as opposed to assuming the book that they are looking for is the most relevant
search result.
